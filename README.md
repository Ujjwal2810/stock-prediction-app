Stock Price Prediction App :
This project uses machine learning to predict stock prices based on historical data. The app employs a deep learning model built with Keras and visualizes stock price trends and predictions. Built with Streamlit, it provides an easy-to-use web interface for analyzing stock price movements.

Features :
Stock Data Visualization: Displays historical stock prices along with key moving averages (MA50, MA100, MA200) to show short-term and long-term trends.
Stock Price Prediction: Predicts future stock prices using a trained deep learning model.
Interactive User Interface: Users can input a stock symbol, select date ranges, and view detailed graphs of stock prices and predictions.
Moving Average Analysis: Overlays 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages on stock prices to identify market trends.
Model Deployment: The app is hosted on Streamlit Cloud, making it easily accessible from anywhere.

Technologies Used :
Streamlit: For building the interactive web application.
Keras: For training the deep learning model that predicts stock prices.
yFinance: For fetching real-time historical stock data.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: For data visualization.

Usage :
Enter a stock symbol (e.g., GOOG, AAPL, MSFT).
The app will display historical data, moving averages, and predictions for the stock price.
Visualize the stock price trends and compare the original vs. predicted prices.
